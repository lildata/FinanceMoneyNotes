# Financial Analysis notes

Notes and quick implementation of the specialization course "Essentials of Corporate Financial Analysis and Decision-Making" by The University of Melbourne and BNY Mellon

This was just created as a way to quickly capture and test concepts learnt in the class using the scala language.

Do not expect it to be a working implementation, well designed or type safe...
